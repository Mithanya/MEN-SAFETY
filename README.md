Men Safety Awareness
About
This project is a small initiative to spread awareness about men’s safety — especially emotional and mental health.
We often forget that men, too, go through silent struggles. This is just a reminder that they deserve a space to express, to be vulnerable, and to feel heard.
Purpose
1.To break the silence around men’s emotional pain
2.To normalize feelings and mental health discussions
3.To encourage empathy from both men and women
4.To visually speak out what many are afraid to say
Tools Used
Napkin AI – for generating the awareness poster
My ideas, emotions, and thoughts – shaped into design

 Note:
Even though I’m a girl, I believe men also deserve a platform to feel free without judgment. This is for every brother, father, friend, or stranger who hides his tears.
